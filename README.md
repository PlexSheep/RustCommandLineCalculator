# RustCommandLineCalcuator
RustCommandLineCalcuator, or simply rclc for short is a fast, scriptable calculator that is 
designed to run right in your shell. No more need to use the python shell, or ugly and bloated
GUIs. Easily calculate complex formulas in your bash scripts.

Currently, rclc's status is `indev`. This means that important major features are still missing
and bugs might not only be possible but common.

# Install
Not yet recommended, but you can always compile rclc by yourself with `cargo build` and copy the
compiled binary executable to `/usr/local/bin`.
